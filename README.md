ðŸ‘‹ Heya! I'm Abi, and I'm on an exciting journey to learn SQL!

ðŸ“š As a newcomer to the world of databases and data manipulation, I'm diving into the realm of SQL to explore its power and potential. I'm eager to discover how SQL can help me organize, analyze, and extract valuable insights from data.

ðŸš€ As I progress I'd also like to start learning about other tools including Github!
